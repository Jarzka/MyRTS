# MyRTS
MyRTS is a multi player Real Time Strategy game prototype. The game is currently in very early stage but some core features have been implemented already like giving simple commands to units and synchronizing the game over network using simultaneous simulations with lockstep-like model. This kind of architectural style has been used in many classic RTS games like Age of Empires.
